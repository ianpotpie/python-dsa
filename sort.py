    Counting sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that operates by counting
    the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on
    those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.
    It is efficient when the range of potential items is not significantly greater
    than the number of items.

    Args:
        arr (list[int]): The input list of integers to be sorted.
        inplace (bool): Whether to sort the list in-place.

    Returns:
        list[int]: The sorted list.

    Time complexity:
        Best case: O(n + k) where n is the number of elements and k is the range of input.
        Worst case: O(n + k) where n is the number of elements and k is the range of input.
        Average case: O(n + k) where n is the number of elements and k is the range of input.

    Space complexity:
        O(k) where k is the range of input.
